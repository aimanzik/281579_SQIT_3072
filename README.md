#Loan House Calculator

This Python script serves as a command-line interface for house loan calculations, providing users with a versatile tool for financial planning. Users can calculate new loans by inputting details such as principal amount, annual interest rate, loan term, monthly income, and other commitments. The script then employs functions to calculate monthly installments, total amounts payable, and Debt Service Ratios (DSR). One notable feature is the ability to store and display previous loan calculations, allowing users to track their financial history and assess patterns. The program also enables users to delete specific entries and modify the DSR threshold for loan eligibility. By incorporating input validation, the script ensures a robust and user-friendly experience. Overall, the tool aids individuals in making informed decisions about housing loans, promoting financial awareness and responsible borrowing.
